    "In this notebook, I will perform an analysis of the Spotify Artist Feature Collaboration Network. The dataset consists of artist data for approximately 20,000 artists whose songs made it to the Spotify weekly charts. Additionally, it includes data for approximately 136,000 additional artists who had at least one feature with at least one of the chart artists. This dataset allows us to construct a network with over 135,000 musicians as nodes and more than 300,000 collaboration edges between them.\n",

    "- **Dataset:** Spotify Artist Feature Collaboration Network\n",
    "- **Source:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jfreyberg/spotify-artist-feature-collaboration-network?resource=download\n",
    "- **Description:** The dataset consists of two CSV files:\n",
    "  - **edges.csv:** Contains edges (features) between artists listed in nodes.csv. The edges are undirected and stored only once. Note that id_0 < id_1 according to alphabetical order, meaning a collaboration between artist A and artist B is stored as id_0:A, id_1:B. It's important to note that only the features of the original 20k seed artists were scraped, meaning non-seed artists do not have features between them in this dataset even if they have them in reality.\n",
    "  - **nodes.csv:** Contains artist information scraped from the Spotify API and kworb.net."

    "The extraction of the giant component from the \"Spotify Artist Feature Collaboration Network\" reveals a fundamental backbone of interconnectedness among artists within the Spotify ecosystem. With 148,386 nodes and 296,770 edges, the giant component represents a substantial and cohesive network where the majority of artists are connected through direct or indirect collaborations. This interconnectedness fosters a vibrant environment for creative exchange, enabling artists to explore diverse musical styles, reach new audiences, and forge meaningful collaborations. The presence of the giant component underscores the resilience and robustness of the network, ensuring the continuity of collaborative interactions even in the face of disruptions. Moreover, within the giant component, influential artists may emerge as central figures, shaping trends, driving innovation, and catalyzing the evolution of musical genres."

    "  - Average degree\n",
    "  - Average shortest path length (calculated on the giant component of a sample of 25% of the original network)\n",
    "  - Network diameter (calculated on the giant component of a sample of 25% of the original network)\n",
    "  - Clustering coefficient\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the large size of the original network, calculating the average shortest path length and network diameter directly on the entire network would be computationally expensive and time-consuming. To mitigate this issue, a sample of 25% of the original network is taken, and these measures are calculated on the giant component of this sample. This approach allows us to obtain reasonable estimates of the average shortest path length and network diameter while reducing computational complexity."

    "\n",
    "##### Average Degree:\n",
    "The average degree of approximately 3.92 suggests that, on average, each artist in the network collaborates with around 4 other artists. In the context of the music industry, this indicates a significant level of collaboration among artists, reflecting the prevalent practice of featuring other artists in songs or albums. The relatively high average degree underscores the interconnectedness of the music industry, where artists frequently collaborate to create new music and reach wider audiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Clustering Coefficient:\n",
    "The clustering coefficient of approximately 0.082 indicates that there is a moderate level of clustering or local connectivity in the network. In the context of the music industry, this suggests the existence of artist communities or cliques where collaborations are frequent and artists often work with others within their social circles or genre-specific groups. These clusters may represent sub-genres, music labels, or artist collectives where collaborations are more common due to shared interests and networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Average Shortest Path Length and Diameter:\n",
    "The average shortest path length of approximately 7.56 and a diameter of 24 within the subsampled giant component suggest that the network has a relatively short average distance between artists, facilitating efficient communication and collaboration. However, the diameter indicates that there are still some distant connections within the network, reflecting the diversity of collaborations across different genres, regions, or popularity levels."

    "1. **Average Degree**:\n",
    "   - The average degree of both the observed and random networks is approximately 3.92, indicating a similar level of connectivity in terms of the average number of collaborations per artist. This similarity suggests that, on average, artists in the observed network collaborate with a similar number of other artists as expected in a random network.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Clustering Coefficient**:\n",
    "   - The clustering coefficient of the observed network (0.082) is significantly higher than that of the random network (2.02e-05). This difference suggests that the observed network exhibits a much higher level of clustering or transitivity, meaning that artists tend to form tightly-knit clusters or communities where collaborations are more likely to occur between connected artists. In contrast, the random network lacks this clustering pattern, with collaborations occurring more randomly without forming cohesive clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Average Shortest Path Length**:\n",
    "   - The average shortest path length of the observed network (7.56) is shorter than that of the random network (29.75), indicating a higher degree of connectivity and accessibility between artists in the observed network. A shorter average shortest path length suggests that artists in the observed network are more closely connected and can reach each other more quickly through collaboration chains compared to the random network, where collaborations are less efficient and take longer to establish.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Diameter**:\n",
    "   - The diameter of the observed network (24) is smaller than that of the random network (68), indicating a more compact and interconnected structure in the observed network. A smaller diameter suggests that the observed network has shorter paths between any two artists compared to the random network, further emphasizing the higher connectivity and efficiency of collaborations within the observed network."
